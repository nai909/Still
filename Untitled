- The "fill" is a brightness/saturation increase, like blood oxygenating
- Unfilled = dimmer (#2A7A75), Filled = bright (#4ECDC4)
- Transition should be smooth gradient along each branch segment, not sudden

**On HOLD-IN:**
- Everything at full brightness
- Alveoli clusters pulse gently (scale 1.0 → 1.05 → 1.0, slow)
- Subtle "shimmer" at endpoints — oxygen exchange happening

**On EXHALE (0 → 1 progress):**
- Reverse the flow — alveoli dim first, then branches, then trunk
- Same staggered timing but inverted
- Color shifts slightly toward cooler/dimmer as CO2 leaves

**On HOLD-OUT:**
- System at rest, baseline dim glow
- Very subtle ambient pulse so it still feels alive
- Ready for next inhale

### 2. ALVEOLI BLOOM EFFECT

When oxygen "arrives" at each alveoli cluster:
- Brief brightness spike (1.0 → 1.5 → 1.0 emissive intensity over 300ms)
- Subtle scale pop (1.0 → 1.08 → 1.0)
- Creates a "ripple" effect as breath reaches the edges
- Should feel like tiny lights turning on in sequence

### 3. TRACHEA ENTRY GLOW

The top center where breath enters needs emphasis:
- Slightly brighter glow at the entry point
- On inhale start, brief "flash" as breath begins (like air rushing in)
- Visual focal point that draws eye to where the journey begins

### 4. PARTICLE OXYGEN DOTS (Optional layer)

Tiny glowing specs that travel through the branches:
```javascript
{
  count: 50-100 particles,
  size: 2-4 pixels,
  color: #4ECDC4 with additive blending,
  behavior: Follow branch paths from trunk to alveoli on inhale,
  speed: Matched to breath progress,
  fade: Particles fade in at trunk, fade out at alveoli
}
```
- Particles should follow the actual branch geometry, not random paths
- Creates sense of flow/movement through the system
- Should be subtle — enhancement, not distraction

### 5. LUNG OUTLINE REFINEMENT

Current outline is visible — make it more subtle:
- Reduce opacity to 0.1-0.15 (barely visible)
- Or remove entirely and let the branches define the lung shape
- If keeping, make it respond to breath (slight expand on inhale, contract on exhale)

### 6. ANATOMICAL ASYMMETRY

Real lungs are asymmetric:
- Right lung: 3 lobes (larger)
- Left lung: 2 lobes (smaller, makes room for heart)
- Adjust branch distribution to reflect this
- Not critical but adds subtle realism

### 7. UI REFINEMENTS

**Countdown number:**
- Reduce size by 20%
- Increase transparency (opacity 0.5)
- Or replace with subtle progress arc around the lungs

**"GENTLE CALM" label:**
- This is the breath pattern name, yes?
- Make smaller and dimmer (opacity 0.4)
- Position top right corner or bottom, away from the visual

**"BREATHE IN" text:**
- Good size and position
- Add subtle fade transition when switching phases (not instant swap)
- Letter-spacing to match "STILL" logo style

### 8. SHADER IMPLEMENTATION

For the progressive fill, use a custom shader on branch segments:
```glsl
uniform float breathProgress;     // 0-1 from breath sync
uniform float depthLevel;         // Which branch depth (0-5)
uniform float branchPosition;     // 0-1 along this branch segment
uniform vec3 colorDim;            // #2A7A75
uniform vec3 colorBright;         // #4ECDC4

void main() {
  // Calculate when this segment should fill based on depth
  float depthDelay = depthLevel * 0.15;
  float depthWindow = 0.25;
  
  // Smooth fill based on breath progress and depth
  float fillStart = depthDelay;
  float fillEnd = depthDelay + depthWindow;
  float depthProgress = smoothstep(fillStart, fillEnd, breathProgress);
  
  // Gradient along branch length (fills from base to tip)
  float lengthFill = smoothstep(0.0, 1.0, depthProgress * 1.5 - (1.0 - branchPosition) * 0.5);
  
  // Final color
  vec3 color = mix(colorDim, colorBright, lengthFill);
  float emissive = lengthFill * 0.6;
  
  gl_FragColor = vec4(color + emissive, 1.0);
}
```

### 9. EXHALE COLOR SHIFT

On exhale, shift the color temperature slightly:
- Inhale/Hold-in: #4ECDC4 (bright teal — oxygenated)
- Exhale/Hold-out: #3AA89F (slightly muted/cooler — deoxygenated)
- Subtle shift, not dramatic — just enough to feel the difference

### 10. PERFORMANCE NOTES

- Keep branch segment count under 500 for mobile performance
- Use instanced meshes for alveoli spheres
- Particles use THREE.Points, not individual meshes
- Target 60fps on iPhone 12 and newer

## PRIORITY ORDER

1. Progressive fill animation (this is the magic)
2. Alveoli bloom on arrival
3. Trachea entry glow
4. Lung outline opacity reduction
5. UI refinements
6. Particle oxygen dots (optional polish)
7. Anatomical asymmetry (optional realism)

Start with the progressive fill shader — once that's working, everything else builds on top of it.
